# Booter (black)List
This project is an effort to automatically collect an extensive list of Booter domain names (BDN). For such, we develop a Booter Classifier that receives URLs (as input) and classifies them as true positive Booter (or not). Although the Booter Classifier works with any URL, to generate faster an extensive list of BDNs by minimizing the number of inputs, we also develop a Booter Crawler that systematic searchs for "potential" BDNS on the Internet.

This research project started at the University of Twente, The Netherlands, by Jair Santanna (https://github.com/jjsantanna) with collaboration of Justyna Chromik and Joey de Vries (https://github.com/JoeyDeVries).
