Search API's Google:
== ========================
1. Custom implementation:
	- Python: with libraries: 
2. Third Party Libraries
	- GoogleScraper seems most promising (and most recent): long list of install requirements though:	- Install:
			- Python version 3.4
			- pip3 install lxml (run apt-get build-dep python-lxml first)
			- also install pip3 install aiohttp
			- then pip3 install GoogleScraper
			- install Xvfb and activate before use with: Xvfb :1 -screen 1 600x400x8 -ac +extension GLX +render -noreset
2. Google Search API




Searching manually on Google:
- Crawler up till page 6;
- Manually searching till page 20 only gave me only 2 Booters extra




- safeskyhacks.com / also interesting place for finding Booter URLs, similar to hackforums, but without login
	- although, I checked the forums but extremely inactive.
